### ðŸ¤– an all purpose discord.js bot
Yurii is an all purpose discord.js bot, with over 20 commands. The bot is maintained by [Zenternal](https://github.com/Zenternal), anyone pretending to own Yurii that doesn't have the github username Zenternal, or the discord tag Zenternal#0212 is an imposter.

### Running Yurii independently
We suggest you do not run this independently, and instead use our public bot which can be found [here](https://yurii.pw/add).\
Yurii was built to work with our machine, and may be unstable if you host it by yourself.\
We open sourced this project so you can understand more how the bot works, and possibly get inspiration for a future project.

We do NOT support using our source code, and hosting your own public bot with it.\
If you're to use our bot independently, use it for private use, and do not try upload it to a bot list. 

#### Installing Yurii
Yurii bot is built for Discord.JS 11.x

When you've downloaded the source files, cd into the directory, and type npm rebuild. This'll download all the packages neccessary to run Yurii.

Everything can be configured in config.json. Replace INSERT-TOKEN to your bot token, and https://yurii.pw with your URL that hosts the yurii-web.

#### Dependencies
 - node-gyp
 - better-sqlite3
